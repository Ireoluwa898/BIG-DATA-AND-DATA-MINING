# BIG-DATA-AND-DATA-MINING
ROAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS
Context:

This task is based on real world data: specifically, road traffic accidents in 2020. 

Project Background Information.
All road traffic accidents involving casualties are logged and reported in Great Britain, along
with (probably) a majority of other non-fatal road traffic accidents. Every year, the government
releases a large batch of data associated with these reports. In this assignment we will be using the data
from 2020.

The Task.
Imagine that you are a data scientist confronted with this data (this is not far from the truth!). Your task
is to advise government agencies about how to improve road safety and create a model that would
predict such accidents and the injuries that they incur.



Tasks are as follows:

Are there significant hours of the day, and days of the week, on which accidents occur?
For motorbikes, are there significant hours of the day, and days of the week, on which accidents occur? We suggest a focus on: Motorcycle 125cc and under, Motorcycle over 125cc and up to 500cc, and Motorcycle over 500cc.
For pedestrians involved in accidents, are there significant hours of the day, and days of the week, on which they are more likely to be involved?
Using the apriori algorithm, explore the impact of selected variables on accident severity.  
Identify accidents in our region: Kingston upon Hull, Humberside, and the East Riding of Yorkshire etc. You can do this by filtering on LSOA, or police region or another method if you can find one. Run clustering on this data. What do these clusters reveal about the distribution of accidents in our region? 
Using outlier detection methods, identify unusual entries in your data set. Should you keep these entries in your data? 
Can you develop a classification model using the provided data that accurately predicts fatal injuries sustained in road traffic accidents, with the aim of informing and improving road safety measures?
